            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="fenu">
                Methi(Fenugreek Leaves):
            </h3>
            <ol type="1" start="1">
               <li> If Methi is well-fried, it will lose some of its bitterness and the taste will be better.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
                Fresh Cream:
            </h3>
            <ol type="1" start="1">
                <li>Fresh Cream helps to balance out the bitterness of Fenugreek and enhances the taste of the curry. Be careful however, not to overcook after the cream is added to prevent oil floating to the top. The curry becomes quite unpalatable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
                A few more points:
            </h3>
            <ol type="1" start="1">
               <li> If one enjoys the taste of Cashew then a few Cashews can be fried and added over and above the cashew paste. In my recipe. I have used only Cashew paste.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1" start="2">
              <li>  All ingredients should be carefully cooked, giving sufficient time for cooking to the core. Oil should be allowed to slowly rise to the top. The taste will be just right.</li>
            </ol>
